# Your First Step into the TSK & Solutech Mentorship Journey 

Hey Tech Sisterüëãüèæ! 
Congratulations on making it to the shortlist for the TSK x Solutech Mentorship Program!

Before we meet in person, we‚Äôd love to get a glimpse of how you think, solve problems, and communicate your ideas. This isn‚Äôt about getting everything ‚Äúright", it‚Äôs about showing your cognitive process and giving us a chance to tailor the mentorship to your needs.
You‚Äôll complete three parts:
- 1Ô∏è‚É£ Logical Thinking & System Design ‚Äî Your take on designing a simple system.
- 2Ô∏è‚É£ Problem Solving with Code ‚Äî A short coding/pseudocode challenge.
- 3Ô∏è‚É£ Video Introduction ‚Äî A chance for us to meet the real you.

## Why this matters: 
This challenge helps us understand your strengths, where you might need support, and how best to pair you with mentors who will bring out your best.

This isn‚Äôt just about lines of code it‚Äôs about how you think, create, and bring people along with you. Here‚Äôs a little challenge to stretch your skills and share your brilliance with the world.

> Scenario:
You are building a system that tracks borrowed library books. Each book has a title, the borrower‚Äôs name, and a due date.
> Your Task:

- What three pieces of data would you store for each book in the system?
- How would you prevent someone from borrowing the same book twice?
- If this system were to scale to 10,000 books and 1,000 users, what parts of your design would need to change or be improved?
- Would you store a book‚Äôs information and its borrowing record together or separately? Why?
### What we‚Äôre looking for:

- Basic understanding of system design and scaling
- Awareness of how to avoid common logic issues
