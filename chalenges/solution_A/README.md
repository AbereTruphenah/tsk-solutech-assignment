## üß† Section A: Logical Thinking & System Design

**Scenario:**  
You're building a system to track borrowed library books. Think through how you'd structure the data and design the system to handle scale and prevent errors.

### ‚úçÔ∏è Challenge Instructions

Answer the following questions **briefly and clearly**. Use bullet points or short sentences where helpful.

---

### üìö 1. Three pieces of data to store for each book:
- What key information would help identify and manage each book?

- **Book ID** (unique identifier for each book edition like ISNB)
- **Book Title & Author** (basic bibliographic information for user-friendly display and search)
- **Availability status** (e.g., "Available", "Borrowed" or "Reserved")


---

### üö´ 2. How to prevent the same book from being borrowed twice:
- What logic or system check would you implement?
- Implement a check on the Availability Status before borrowing: when a user attempts to borrow a book, the system first checks the book's Status field. If it's "Available," the status is immediately updated to "Borrowed" in the same operation.
- Use database-level locking or transactions to ensure only one borrow operation can occur at a time for a given book ID.


---

### üìà 3. Scaling to 10,000 books and 1,000 users ‚Äî what needs to change:
- What would you update in your design or infrastructure to handle this growth?
- Use database indexing (e.g., on Book ID, User ID, status) for faster searches.
- Implement caching mechanisms to reduce database queries and improve performance.
- Move to a more scalable database such as PostgreSQL to handle concurrent access, structured data and transactions efficiently.
- Ensure the system supports concurrent transactions without conflicts.
- Implement search filters and pagination to manage UI and performance.

---

### üîÑ 4. Store book info and borrowing record together or separately ‚Äî why?
- Share your reasoning for how you'd structure the data.
- **Store separately** ‚Äî Book info (ISBN, title, author) changes rarely, borrowing records (borrower, borrow date, return date) change often.

**Reasoning:**
Redundancy Reduction: Separating prevents duplicating book information every time it's borrowed.
Query Efficiency: Separating makes it easier to search for all books by an author (querying the books table) or find all books a user has ever borrowed (querying the borrows table).
Flexibility: Separating allows a single book to have multiple borrowing records over its lifetime without cluttering the book's main entry.

Take your time to think through each part. We're looking for clarity, logic, and practical design thinking. Good luck!
