## 🧠 Section A: Logical Thinking & System Design

**Scenario:**  
You're building a system to track borrowed library books. Think through how you'd structure the data and design the system to handle scale and prevent errors.

---

### ✍️ Challenge Instructions

Answer the following questions **briefly and clearly**. Use bullet points or short sentences where helpful.

---

### 📚 1. Three pieces of data to store for each book:
- What key information would help identify and manage each book?

---

### 🚫 2. How to prevent the same book from being borrowed twice:
- What logic or system check would you implement?

---

### 📈 3. Scaling to 10,000 books and 1,000 users — what needs to change:
- What would you update in your design or infrastructure to handle this growth?

---

### 🔄 4. Store book info and borrowing record together or separately — why?
- Share your reasoning for how you'd structure the data.

---

Take your time to think through each part. We're looking for clarity, logic, and practical design thinking. Good luck!
